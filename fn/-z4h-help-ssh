Usage: %F{2}z4h%f %Bssh%b [%Ussh-options%u] [%Uuser@%u]%Uhostname%u

Connect to the remote host over SSH and start Zsh with local configs.
The remote host must have login shell compatible with the Bourne shell
(sh, bash, zsh, ash, dash, etc.) and internet connection. Nothing else
is required.

Here's what %F{2}z4h%f %Bssh%b does in more detail:

  1. Archives Zsh config files on the local host and sends them to the
     remote host.
  2. Extracts Zsh config files on the remote host.
  3. Sources %U.zshrc%u, which starts the usual %Bzsh4humans%b bootstrap
     process.

%BZDOTDIR%b and %BZ4H%b on the remote host both point to
%F{3}"${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/z4h-ssh"%f. This prevents clashes
with regular Zsh configs if they exist.

%BZ4H_SSH%b on the remote host is set to %B1%b.

The first login to a remote host may take some time. After that it's as
fast as normal %F{2}ssh%f.
