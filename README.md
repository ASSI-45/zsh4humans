# Zsh for Humans

Single-file configuration for Zsh with sane defaults.

## Installation

1. Install `zsh` and `git`.
2. *Optional*: Install [powerlevel10k font](
  https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/blob/master/README.md#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k).
3. Download [.zshrc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romkatv/zsh4humans/master/.zshrc) to your
   home directory.
```zsh
curl -fsSLo ~/.zshrc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romkatv/zsh4humans/master/.zshrc
```
4. Start `zsh`.

## Features

Just Works.

## Customization

Edit `~/.zshrc`.

## Updating

When you start Zsh, you'll be prompted to update dependencies (zsh-syntax-highlighting, fzf, etc.)
every two weeks. You can also force update with `z4h-update`.

There is no update mechanism for `~/.zshrc` itself.
